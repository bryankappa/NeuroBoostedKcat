# NeuroBoostedKcat
In the dynamic and evolving realm of enzyme kinetics, quantifying the turnover number (Kcat) for Transferases plays an integral role in understanding their catalytic efficiency. Our project, NeuroBoostedKcat, represents an avant-garde approach, converging deep learning with traditional boosting methodologies to achieve this goal with enhanced precision.

# Purpose
While the immediate application is geared towards predicting Kcat values for Transferases, the framework's modularity and scalability make it adaptable to other enzyme classes. It holds promise in drug discovery, metabolic engineering, and other biotechnological applications where enzymatic efficiency prediction is paramount.

# Future
Plans are underway to integrate additional boosting models, explore ensemble strategies, and tap into unsupervised learning paradigms to further enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we're looking at potential collaborations with bioinformatics platforms to integrate our model, making it accessible to a wider audience.
